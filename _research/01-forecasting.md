Our team is working to develop statistical methods and tools that can improve
real-time infectious disease forecasting efforts for a variety of diseases,
including [COVID-19](https://covid19forecasthub.org/), [dengue fever](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1714457115) 
and [influenza](https://www.pnas.org/content/116/8/3146). We focus on building robust 
and interpretable models that can be used by public health officials to drive 
policy decisions. For example, in a collaboration with the Ministry of Public 
Health in Thailand, our team built statistical forecast models to predict 
outbreaks of dengue fever in real-time from early 2014 through 2019 for each of the 77 
provinces in Thailand. 
We also have worked closely with the CDC to produce [ensemble forecasts of influenza](http://flusightnetwork.io/) and [COVID-19](https://covid19forecasthub.org/).
From a methodological perspective we work on developing 
ensemble methodology (fusing together forecasts from multiple models) and on 
forecasting methods that can account for reporting delays in surveillance data.
