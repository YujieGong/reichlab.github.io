The hubverse is a collection of open-source software and data tools that enables collaborative modeling exercises. 
It is developed by the Consortium of Infectious Disease Modeling Hubs, a collaboration of research teams and public health professionals
that have built and maintained predictive modeling hubs for infectious disease applications. The goal of the Consortium of Infectious
Disease Modeling Hubs is to develop a central open-source suite of tools for creating, hosting, maintaining, and running a modeling hub.
Working together, we have developed the hubverse for groups that are running collaborative modeling hub efforts.
