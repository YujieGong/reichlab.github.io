Cluster-randomized trials are a type of clinical trial where clusters of individuals are randomized instead of individuals. In our work on several high-profile cluster-randomized clinical trials -- including [the ResPECT Study](https://doi.org/10.1001/jama.2019.11645) (funded by CDC and VA), [the SCRUB Trial](http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(12)61687-0/fulltext), and a telehealth collaborative care trial for HIV patients (funded by VA) -- we have developed simulation methods for calculating power for cluster-randomized and cluster-randomized crossover trials. These methods are available as an R software package, clusterPower. In other work, we have developed theory around the covariate-adjusted residual estimator (CARE) and its use in both randomized trials and observational settings to estimate causal effects of interest.
